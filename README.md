Project Title - Data Quality Improvement for Medical Concept Normalization

Technologies Used: Python, Twitter API, MS Excel, Python libraries(Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, seaborn)
In this project automatically recognizing medical concepts mentioned in social media texts are used to enhance the people's health quality in a community. However, the discrepancy between the language used in social media (such as Twitter and Facebook) and the medical concepts have been challenging. Evaluated the approaches using three different datasets, where social media texts are extracted from Twitter or Facebook messages. Poor data quality has also a direct impact on the machine learning systems. This first, exposed from a dataset that has a hidden problem that is used to build machine learning concepts. Due to the poor quality of the dataset and the defective validation process, the results of the experiment showed great performance. The results also demonstrated that the evaluation of data quality is useful for guiding the quality improvement of machine learning. Therefore, proposed a data quality evaluation framework that includes the quality and their corresponding approaches
